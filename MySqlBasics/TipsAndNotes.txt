Tips and notes:

*"Commands out of sync; you can't run this command now" -> PHP
Print the mysql error (surely there is but php is so clever that it does not show it)
if appears "Commands out of sync; you can't run this command now" 
is because at one query or procedure there are rows that have not been read or some procedure has gotten stuck (it happens a lot with procedures, don't know why yet)
Solution: After detected the query that gives the error add (suposing $res is the result of your query and $connection your connection to mysql)
$res->close();
$connection->next_result();


*Enumerate sorted rows with update:
update students set listNum=(select count(*) from students as tmpStudents where tmpStudents.curp <= students.curp)
-- "tmpStudents" is like a temporary table because on update or on delete you can't make querys to the actual table
-- so you gotta make a "temporary" table


*Erase tables with temporary key
-- temporal workaround to erase test tables blocked by a foreign key error
set FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=0;
drop table tableToDrop;
set FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=1;


*Get cant of repeated matches in a table
select word, Count(*) as count from uncommonWords group by word order by count;


*On update / On delete actions
CASCADE:
 will propagate the change when the parent changes. (If you delete a row, rows in constrained tables that reference that row will also be deleted, etc.) Also, note that cascading foreign key actions do not activate triggers in MySQL.

SET NULL:
 sets the column value to NULL when a parent row goes away.

RESTRICT:
causes the attempted DELETE of a parent row to fail.

NO ACTION: 
is equivalent to RESTRICT. 


*Procedures-Functions-IF statements
DELIMITER //
create procedure exist(in _usr varchar(32))
begin
if (select count(usr) from users where usr=_usrs)=1
then select 1;
else select 0;
end if;
end//
call existUser("User");
